You cannot transfer a single cPanel & WHM license across multiple servers. This action may cause cPanel, L.L.C. to lock your license.

cPanel DNSOnly requires a DNSOnly license, which the server automatically obtains during installation.

cPanel & WHM requires a valid license. If this is a new installation, you can activate a free 15-day trial license.

Hostname: A registered fully-qualified hostname that does not match any of your serverâ€™s domains and resolves to a valid IPv4 or IPv6 address.

IP addresses
    A valid IP address.
    A valid subnet address.
    A default gateway IP address.
    A 1:1 NAT and NAT loopback configuration if you server resides in a NAT-configured network.
    
A properly-configured Ethernet device with a static IP address and fully-qualified hostname. The system attempts to detect and set the ethernet device during the installation process.

Warning:
You cannot use an IP address that a DHCP service dynamically assigns to your server.
